# Preamble

Whereas all persons are born into a natural state of freedom,
and whereas all persons are entitled to complete ownership over their entire selves,
and whereas all persons are entitled to equally access natural opportunities,
and whereas greater human organization is desirable for the common advantage
and general advancement of humankind,
we establish the Golden Liberty League of Cities and Citizens
for as long as it supports and ensures
a free, just, and peaceful society
in accord with these truths.

# I: Natural persons

## Rights of all persons

The League shall acknowledge and affirm
all inherent natural rights
belonging to each and every individual.

All persons,
regardless of place of origin,
opinions or religious beliefs held publicly or privately,
or arbitrary physical attribute,
shall be treated equally,
with dignity and respect,
under the law.

All persons are the owners over their entire person
and the products of their labors.
All persons are naturally free
to pursue their own happiness and prosperity,
voluntarily associate with others for any mutual end,
express themselves through speech, writing, or any other media,
and engage in any other behavior
which neither threatens or commits violence against, nor defrauds another.
All persons have an equal natural right
to move about the earth,
and to make use of the natural opportunities which it provides.

All persons have the inherent and natural right
to adequately defend themselves from transgressions,
or enlist an agent to so on their behalf,
and to seek appropriate remunerative or punitive damages
for those which are committed.

## Rights of the accused

Any person accused of transgressing against the rights of another
shall be presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt
by a jury of their citizen peers
or another arbiter which may be agreed upon by all parties.

No accused person shall be detained or searched without a warrant,
nor shall an accused person be held
in unnecessary detention awaiting trial,
nor shall such trial be delayed
any more than necessary to ensure its adequate fairness.

Damages sought from, and sanctions sought against, guilty parties
shall not excessively surpass the degree of the original transgression,
nor shall any punitive sanction be enacted
which offends a reasonable sense of justice.

# II: Cities

## Naturalization of Cities

No City,
having demonstrated the capacity and willingness
to maintain a jurisdiction capable of upholding
its responsibilities under this Constitution,
shall be barred entry to the League.

Cities shall be admitted into the League
if such is demanded by
a popular vote of the candidate City's inhabitants
and with the consent of a 1st-order plurality vote
from both Councils of the League
affirming the fitness of the City
to meet its obligations under this Constitution.

Should any City fail to sustain
its obligations under this Constitution,
its membership may be revoked
by a Directive of the Councils.

## Right to secession

of each of its Citizens.

The administration of a City's powers and duties

Cities shall have the authority to standardize
the criminal and civil codes

Cities shall have the authority to restrict and regulate
any activity within its borders
which patently and directly disturbs
adjacent and surrounding areas
but have been typically found not to

activities conducted on the commons they provide.

## Collection of natural rent

Cities may charge,

the land and natural opportunities

make exclusive use of such natural opportunities
and willing to pay its rent.

## Power to spend

Cities may allocate,
at the discretion of its most representative council,
a portion of the natural rent collected
for the purposes of executing its duties,
and to provide for the commons, common services, and common infrastructure.

For the purposes of accounting
and allowing for the fair competition of alternative uses,
Cities shall fairly compete for,
and pay the appropriate rent for,
all land and natural opportunities
they wish to allocate to such common purposes.

## Citizen's dividend

All natural rent collected by the City
not otherwise allocated by the City's most representative house,
nor allocated to the League,
shall be returned in equal shares to its Citizens.

used for the collection of natural rent
and the distribution of the Citizen's dividend.
Any currency minted by the City for such purposes
must only enter circulation through the Citizen's dividend.

## Harboring fugitives

If a constituent of the League have a lawful claim against a person,
no City may provide sanctuary or refuge for that person.
Cities shall not inhibit
any lawful efforts of an offended City or the League
to bring a person to court in the appropriate jurisdiction.
