## What is Golden Liberty?

Golden Liberty is first and foremost a model constitutional framework
which synthesizes a number of philosophies
and political and economic theories, including:

1. Individual agency: Each person possesses the capacity to choose and act,
  from which sovereignty over oneself and one's efforts follows.
2. Voluntarism: Agents cooperate and form governance
  when doing so serves their interests;
  all association is by explicit agreement.
3. Geoism: the unique role of land in social organization
  and economic justice is recognized
  and makes the foundation for establishing governance.
4. Customary law: Justice is primarily established
  through applying justice on a case-by-case basis;
  legislation of criminal statues is restricted
  to synthesizing the standards applied in past cases.
5. Republicanism: Equal access to government is available to all citizens.
6. Separation of powers: Independent entities are established
  for implementing independent aspects of governance.
7. Cellular democracy: Small political organisms, starting with individuals,
  form voluntary alliances with others
  to create larger ones.
8. Voting theory: Various voting and electoral systems
  are used in different contexts
  in ways which align with the intended outcomes.

## How would Golden Liberty be implemented?

Though currently this framework has only been created in the abstract,
it is the intent that if this were to be implemented,
it would be done so using blockchain technology
making heavy use of DAO-like systems.
