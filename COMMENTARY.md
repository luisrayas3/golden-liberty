## Why constitutional land trusts (Cities)?

The core tenet behind Golden Liberty is the recognition of
the central role land plays in human organization.
Respecting this foundational role of land,
Golden Liberty bases its political organism around the same.
This establishes the foundational organizational unit, the "City",
directly on the notion of stewardship of land.

The first imperative is to understand why
land must play the central role.

The first reason land is central to human organization
is that it is quite literally the canvas
on which human rules are painted.
Rules are applied first and foremost to locations;
only occasionally are they applied to specific people
regardless of their location.
This is the notion of jurisdiction from which
we see that it is the establishment of a jurisdiction
is the original act of government.
The only just government,
the only legitimate government,
can be one where the claim to jurisdiction,
the claim to land itself,
is legitimate and just.

The second reason why land is central to human organization
is that it is the only resource
which a person is unable to produce themselves.
Land is supplied absent human action and without prejudice.
This means that land can only be taken,
whether directly from nature or from another claimant;
it can never be created.
This makes land the mother of human conflict
and the distribution of land the unique demand
of public authority.

In fact, we submit that the _only_ reason
human association should be
rendered through public organization
is if it lays final claim
to land or the natural opportunities therein.
No other human activity requires such attention.
On the contrary, public organization
in any other aspect of human association
besides management of the commons
(land and the natural opportunities therein)
violates individual self-ownership,
which is nothing to say of its abysmal track record
for producing peace or prosperity.

A constitutional land trust is therefore
a sovereign steward of its lands which
upholds a standard of justice on those lands
recognizing both the individual right to self-ownership
and the common right of all individuals to make use of
land and its natural opportunities.

## What makes a City?

To be considered a legitimate and just steward of land,
a City must abide by certain principles
and meet certain responsibilities,
this being the "constitutional" aspect of "constitutional land trust".
These principles, responsibilities, and limitations are,
by necessary definition in a just society,
exactly those which make for a just claim on land.

0. At inception, a city can only be established by consensus of its residents.

1. The principle of individual self-ownership,
  that is the sovereignty of independent persons
  and their rights to life, liberty, and the fruits of their labor,
  must be recognized within the jurisdiction.

2. The city must collect ground rent
  on all private appropriations of land and natural opportunities,
  returning it to its citizens as a citizen's dividend.

3. There must be no prejudice in the naturalization of new citizens.

4. The land must be protected from external threats.

### 0. Inception

Reaching consensus is tricky,
in the general case it is not really sufficient
that 50% of residents agree to the establishment of government
as this leaves too much of an open door for tyranny of the majority.
Then again maybe it is, depending on what the pool of options is.
On the other hand,
no sovereign claim to land can ever be expected
to be agreeable to all people.
If there were no disagreements,
and no need for arbitration,
there would be no need for any organization at all.
Most likely the best choice would be the system which
wins by approval voting
against all other possible systems of community organization.

That said, the moral principles of Golden Liberty are sound.
Though it may be too much to ask to "prove"
that Golden Liberty embodies true justice,
it may be sufficient to lean on its moral soundness
and accept a vote of confidence from current residents
only as a sanity check that there is no coercion.
For though democracy is the worst form of government,
it is better than all other forms that have been tried.

### 1. Individual sovereignty

### 2. Ground rent and the citizen's dividend

* Ensure there is no incentive to spend collected rent on special interests.

* By original justifications, the rent belongs directly to the people,
  not to the collective.

* "Public" spending could much more plausibly be realized in the private market.
  * People are getting a dividend which they can part with
    easier than they can a part of their paycheck.
  * Eminent domain is not necessary.

On the other hand, the power to spend:
* We should allow some experimentation
  with the provisioning of public goods.
* With a citizen's dividend,
  the incentive for everyone is actually for efficient government.
But of course:
* There is always the possibility of cronyism!
* There is the possibility of tyranny of the majority as well:
  some improvements to land will not be seen
  as improvements to everyone equally.

### 3. Naturalization & open borders

### 4. Common defense & national sovereignty

## Powers & responsibilities of the League

### Defense & national sovereignty

The power for the league to defend
its constituent lands and people against foreign threats
is at once the most incidental and the most fundamental of powers.

On the one hand,
recognizing first the ultimate sovereignty of the individual
and then the sovereignty of a City's lands,
there shouldn't be, in a perfect world,
a need for a unified material defense.
However, this being an imperfect world
which enfranchises primarily large state-like actors,
we find it necessary to create the League
in order to both defend itself from larger state-like actors
and to enfranchise its constituent sovereigns
in the greater political sphere.
In this sense it is a power made necessary
only by the imperfection of the greater political order.

On the other hand,
were this not a necessary power to grant the League,
there would be substantially less reason
to establish the League in the first place.
The remaining advantage would be
a shared agreement as to what is required
for a City's government to be just
and perhaps more common standards of cooperation.
These advantages may, but also may not, be
sufficient for Cities to seek membership in a League.
Put another way, the common defense
and representation in international affairs
are the most unifying and advantageous functions of League.
In this light,
the other provisions made by the establishment of the League
are simply protections for ensuring that
this great power of national organization
is not wielded on behalf of people or lands
where injustices are perpetrated or permitted.
It is in this sense possibly
the most fundamental of the powers of the League.

#### Independent militias

Unlike for example the American constitution,
the commander of the national military (the President)
cannot compel the various militias into national service.
This adds an extra check
on the power of the national armed forces.
The intent of the Militias is first and foremost
their localized defense.

# Establishment of the League

> Why should cities join together?

All powers granted to the League
are granted for the sole purpose
of protecting its Cities' land and its Citizens
and ensuring a fair application of the standards of justice
set forth in the Constitution.
