# Commentary on the Golden Liberty constitution

Legal concepts are technologies with a surprising amount of power.
But if the concepts themselves,
or the principles with which they are combined,
are not rooted in a rock-solid moral foundation
_as well as_ rock-solid practical foundations,
we should not be surprised if they yield
undesirable outcomes and unintended side-effects.

To this end, this commentary strives to justify
the major aspects of the Constitution of Golden Liberty
on a first-principles basis.

## Why constitutional land trusts (Cities)?

The core tenet behind Golden Liberty is the recognition of
the central role land plays in human organization.
Respecting this foundational role of land,
Golden Liberty bases its political organism around the same.
This establishes the foundational organizational unit, the "City",
directly on the notion of stewardship of land.

The first imperative is to understand why
land must play the central role.

The first reason land is central to human organization
is that it is quite literally the canvas
on which human rules are painted.
Rules are applied first and foremost to locations;
only occasionally are they applied to specific people
regardless of their location.
This is the notion of jurisdiction from which
we see that it is the establishment of a jurisdiction
is the original act of government.
The only just government,
the only legitimate government,
can be one where the claim to jurisdiction,
the claim to land itself,
is legitimate and just.

The second reason why land is central to human organization
is that it is the only resource
which a person is unable to produce themselves.
Land is supplied absent human action and without prejudice.
This means that land can only be taken,
whether directly from nature or from another claimant;
it can never be created.
This makes land the mother of human conflict
and the distribution of land the unique demand
of public authority.

In fact, we submit that the _only_ reason
human association should be
rendered through public organization
is if it lays final claim
to land or the natural opportunities therein.
No other human activity requires such attention.
On the contrary, public organization
in any other aspect of human association
besides management of the commons
(land and the natural opportunities therein)
violates individual self-ownership,
which is nothing to say of its abysmal track record
for producing peace or prosperity.

A constitutional land trust is therefore
a sovereign steward of its lands which
upholds a standard of justice on those lands
recognizing both the individual right to self-ownership
and the common right of all individuals to make use of
land and its natural opportunities.

## What makes a City?

To be considered a legitimate and just steward of land,
a City must abide by certain principles
and meet certain responsibilities,
this being the "constitutional" aspect of "constitutional land trust".
These principles, responsibilities, and limitations are,
by necessary definition in a just society,
exactly those which make for a just claim on land.

0. At inception, a city can only be established by consensus of its residents.

1. The principle of individual self-ownership,
  that is the sovereignty of independent persons
  and their rights to life, liberty, and the fruits of their labor,
  must be recognized within the jurisdiction.

2. The city must collect ground rent
  on all private appropriations of land and natural opportunities,
  returning it to its citizens as a citizen's dividend.

3. There must be no prejudice in the naturalization of new citizens.

4. The land must be protected from external threats.

### 0. Inception

Reaching consensus is tricky,
in the general case it is not really sufficient
that 50% of residents agree to the establishment of government
as this leaves too much of an open door for tyranny of the majority.
Then again maybe it is, depending on what the pool of options is.
On the other hand,
no sovereign claim to land can ever be expected
to be agreeable to all people.
If there were no disagreements,
and no need for arbitration,
there would be no need for any organization at all.
Most likely the best choice would be the system which
wins by approval voting
against all other possible systems of community organization.

That said, the moral principles of Golden Liberty are sound.
Though it may be too much to ask to "prove"
that Golden Liberty embodies true justice,
it may be sufficient to lean on its moral soundness
and accept a vote of confidence from current residents
only as a sanity check that there is no coercion.
For though democracy is the worst form of government,
it is better than all other forms that have been tried.

### 1. Individual sovereignty

This principle simply declares that
the fairly well-accepted principle of self-ownership applies.
Without individual sovereignty,
some other political entity must necessarily
reign as master over the individual.
Such an arrangement, no matter how well intentioned,
no matter how carefully designed,
is intrinsically a vehicle for the abuse of power.
It cannot be allowed in a free society.

### 2. Ground rent and the citizen's dividend

The collection of ground rent is well-understood by Georgists and geoists
to be an economically-wise manner of breaking up land monopoly
inherent in systems with absolute property in land.
This is the first step in ensuring equal access
to the natural opportunities of the earth.

But what to do with the collected rent?
In order to truly provide equal opportunity
it is necessary to distribute the rent back to citizens.
If this is done maximally,
that is 100% of the rent is returned as a citizen's dividend,
it has the effect of distributing land values
exactly equally amongst all citizens.
It also bestows individuals with the maximum liberty
to decide how to use that captured value,
in essence, their share of the land.
Such a system is superior to other
voting-based methods of distributing the rent
in the matter of giving power people.

In short, by our original justifications,
the rent belogs directly to the people,
not to the collective.

There is a distinct practical advantage too:
it provides a strong check against
the City spending the collected rent on special interests.
Citizen's can in fact measure the quality of their government
meaningfully and quantitatively
by the magnitute of the citizen's dividend.
The value a government does provide,
whether due to its fair jurisdiction or its public works,
manifests itself in land values and ultimately in the ground rent,
whereas the cost of government comes
directly out of what otherwise would be the citizen's dividend.
It aligns incentives perfectly.

And what about public spending?
This is a tricky one.
In theory there are public works which
benefit everyone more than their cost
and could not be easily provided
at a more granular level than the city.
Consider parks, walkways, and city defense.
Yet there is a risk that by spending on any project,
there will be some citizen's who
do not value that benefit as much as others.
In any case the government is still incentivized
to provide its works efficiently (raises rents by more than the works cost),
and thus it should not actually decrease
the size of the citizen's dividend for these citizens.
But the cost will still be borne in higher rents.

A further risk is the possibility of cronyism.
The greater the mandate for a government body
to decide how resources are to be used,
the greater the threat of special interests
(which benefit not even a majority)
finding a way to subvert the democratic value of the spend.

At the same time,
where a citizen's dividend is maximized
it becomes much more plausible that
"public" works could be financed privately.
How so? People are generous when they can be.
In a world where improvements to one's community
benefit a person directly and financially
in the form of a higher citizen's dividend,
and people are not burdened by taxes on their production
nor the "tax" of land monopoly,
it is not unreasonable to imagine that
voluntary donations to public works such as parks would thrive.

Ultimately, the city does need *some* resources,
if not to at least carry out collection and distribution of rent.
City defense and an arbitration or judicial system for its affairs
also are strictly necessary to the establishment of a city.
For these purposes, and to support
a healthy degree of experimentation in the provisioning of public goods,
the City does retain a power to spend.
It is nonetheless intended that such power be
strongly checked by the citizen's dividend
and furthermore a moderate super-majority
ought to be preferred for matters of public spending.

### 3. Naturalization & open borders

Without open borders,
the promise of equality under the law
and equal opportunity are hollow.
This is self-evident, if sometimes forgotten.

### 4. Common defense & national sovereignty

If a city is not defended, it ceases to exist.
This principle is explored further below
at the level of the League as a whole.

## Powers & responsibilities of the League

All powers granted to the League
are granted for the sole purposes
of protecting its Cities' land and Citizens from large-scale threats
and ensuring a fair application of the standards of justice
set forth in the Constitution.

No other purpose should be recognized for the League.
To do so would create a power leak
in which a collective exercises an unjust power
over the sovereignty of the individual
and local communities.

### Defense & national sovereignty

The power for the League to defend
its constituent lands and people against foreign threats
is at once the most incidental and the most fundamental of powers.

On the one hand,
recognizing first the ultimate sovereignty of the individual
and then the sovereignty of a City's lands,
there shouldn't be, in a perfect world,
a need for a unified material defense.
However, this being an imperfect world
which enfranchises primarily large state-like actors,
we find it necessary to create the League
in order to both defend itself from larger state-like actors
and to enfranchise its constituent sovereigns
in the greater political sphere.
In this sense it is a power made necessary
only by the imperfection of the wider global political order.

On the other hand,
were this not a necessary power to grant the League,
there would be substantially less reason
to establish the League in the first place.
The remaining advantage would be
a shared agreement as to what is required
for a City's government to be just
and perhaps more common standards of cooperation.
These advantages may, but also may not, be
sufficient for Cities to seek membership in a League.
Put another way, the common defense
and representation in international affairs
are the most unifying and advantageous functions of League.
In this light,
the other provisions made by the establishment of the League
are simply protections for ensuring that
this great power of national organization
is not wielded on behalf of people or lands
where injustices are perpetrated or permitted.
It is in this sense possibly
the most fundamental of the powers of the League.

#### Independent militias

Unlike for example the American constitution,
the commander of the national military (the President)
cannot compel the various militias into national service.
This adds an extra check
on the power of the national armed forces.
The intent of the Militias is first and foremost
their localized defense.

### Court for constitutional issues

Unlike other "supreme courts",
the Constitutional Court only has jurisdiction
on constitutional matters.
This follows naturally from
a sort of legal application of the "rule of least power"
and distributed governance in general.
There really is no justification for
this court to consider any civil or criminal matters,
as it is outside of the scope for the League to begin with.

That said, an established method for arbitration
when matters of the constitution are under question
is strictly a necessity.
This is the (only) mandate of the court.
